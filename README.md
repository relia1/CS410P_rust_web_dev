The Rust Programming Language is experiencing rapid adoption in part due to its ability to provide easy, fast and safe programming for systems that span low-level and high-level concerns. Rust is increasingly being used to write Web services, including back-ends, front-ends, microservices and clients. A number of high-quality Rust web server and client frameworks are available to support this activity. In this course students will learn to work with Rust and the Web.
